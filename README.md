FUNCTIONALITY
- Stockfish
- Book Openings are all recognized.
- Imbalances explained. Based off of Jeremy Silman's concepts of imbalances.
- Action-Replay. Will replay the move and highlight all relevant squares.
- Step by step explanation. App walks the user through each imbalance in a list of pros & cons.

NOTES
- Still alpha stage. Best analysis currently occurs with pawn moves and captures.
- Book openings are not analyzed. Theory already exists.

TODO
- Need additional analysis for key squares. 
- Need tactic analysis added. i.e) Forks, checks, zugzwang, zwischenzug, etc.
